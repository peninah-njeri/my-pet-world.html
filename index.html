    <h1>My loyal Friend</h1>
    <h2>Jimmy</h2>

    <p>I loved Jimmy since the very first day. She is an adorable dog always there for me.</p>
    <p>His loyalty is out of this world.</p>
    <h2>His House</h2>
    <p>We made this small house for Jimmy so that he can also have his own resting place when he wants to be alone</p>
    <p>He loves his cabin so much such that during those alone moments you find her resting there.</p>

    <h2>A list of things that Jimmy loves</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Paying ball</li>
        <li>Going for a walk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jimmy hates his four things starting with what he dislike the most</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Sleeping outside</li>
        <li>Dirty environnment</li>
